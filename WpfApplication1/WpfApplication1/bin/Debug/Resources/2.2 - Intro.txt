You hear sounds, the crackle of a fire, the blowing of the wind;
You feel ground underneath you, you're lying down?

Opening your eyes, and sitting up, a rocky outcrop surrounds you, your camp.

Your camp... what's there to say? It's a dusty, rocky patch of ground filled with a simple
campfire, bedroll, and assorted supplies.

This has been your home for the better part of the month, where you've been stationed to watch
for incoming Shadow forces that might threatern the Capital.
