The world is foggy around you, yet you dont notice.
Objects materialize around you, yet nothing seems wrong.
Your suddenly at your home, in your bed, this doesnt seem odd to you.

Sitting up, you look around, "Today's the day." you realise, this is when you head to the Capital.
To join the other Chosen, to fight the Shadows.
