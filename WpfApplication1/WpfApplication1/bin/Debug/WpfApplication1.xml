The world is foggy around you, yet you dont notice.
Objects materialize around you, yet nothing seems wrong.
Your suddenly at your home, in your bed, this doesnt seem odd to you.

Sitting up, you look around, "Today's the day." you realise, this is when you head to the Capital.
To join the other Chosen, to fight the Shadows.
You take a step to the door, opening it, light floods around you.

You hear sounds, the crackle of a fire, the blowing of the wind;
You feel ground underneath you, you're lying down?

Opening your eyes, and sitting up, a rocky outcrop surrounds you, your camp.

Your camp... what's there to say? It's a dusty, rocky patch of ground filled with a simple
campfire, bedroll, and assorted supplies.

This has been your home for the better part of the month, where you've been stationed to watch
for incoming Shadow forces that might threatern the Capital.
